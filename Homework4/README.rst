To run this code, you must first have a python version greater than 3 installed.
Then you run it like a python file.

For part 1, you don't need any additional commands besides the main python command described below.

For part 2, you need the python command and the file/filepath associated with the genome.

To run each of the homework questions:

Example: python basic_simulations.py homework_problem_part filepath

-- PART 1A --
1A: python basic_simulations.py 1A filename


-- PART 1B --
1B: python basic_simulations.py 1B filename


-- PART 2A --
1C: python basic_simulations.py 2A filename


-- PART 2B --
1D: python basic_simulations.py 2B filename


-- PART 2C --
2A: python basic_simulations.py 2C filename
